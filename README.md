## Notes
A half-open piece: There are aspects that I don't want to specify, but I don't put the burden of creation on the performers. Designed to be an approachable piece of process music. Designed to accomidate chamber groups with between three and ten performers, lasting between three and seven minutes.

## Requirements:

- Python
- Lilypond
